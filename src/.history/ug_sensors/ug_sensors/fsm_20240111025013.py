"""
    Finite State Machine to subscribe to sensors and publish to actuators.
    This FSM will be controly by hybrid control system. The structure of the control system is to be determined. My humble guess is that we will be using layered control system structure. PID for low level control and other forms of control for high-level behavior control.
