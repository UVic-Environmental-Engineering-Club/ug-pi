## Documentation from hacking the barometric sensor into my ros2 node

Since colcon moves everything around while building, regular "import file_name" will not work.
By doing
    print(sys.path)
at the top of a python file, building with colcon, and running it,
we will see the paths exposed to python.
If the module that is meant to be imported is in a subdir of that list, the path must be
stated in the import as:
    dir1.dir2.module

For this specific project, this usually will look like:
linking modules after building with colcon: pkg_dir.file_name

Every file must be imported in this way.

Since the scripts have already been written with an assumption as to what the module names are,
I found importing as the original name was best practice.

For example:
    Original import:
        import ms5837
    New import:
        import sensor.ms5837 as ms5837

Keep in mind this must be done for every required file, I had to go 3 deep.
