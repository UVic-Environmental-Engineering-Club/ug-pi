    This creates a ros2 node that reads from the depth
    sensor and publishes the readings to the sensor topic.

    In its current state, this code can be used as a base for any
    sensor node.

    DONE: Create a ros2 node that publishes data to a topic.

    TODO: Develop the sensor interface with David.

    DONE: Get data from the sensor, requires appropriate libs
            and hardware (raspberry pi and sensor).

    TODO: Should a separate node be created for temperature?
